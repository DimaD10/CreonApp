# CreonApp

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About 

A simple web application using **Next.JS** to demonstrate my project structuring, motion designing and working with some tools and libraries. 
The application is fully adaptive for any screen resolution and for any client. I also added a simple but beautiful animation of elements when scrolling and for interaction with some elements that call for action.


## Tools:

1. **Next.JS 14** To build the application.
2. **TypeScript** for typify.
3. **SCSS preprocessor** for convenient application styling.
4. **Module CSS approach** for unique styles for each component and convenience in the context of class names.
5. **Tailwind CSS** for convenient and quick styling of components and their elements.
6. **Lucide Icons library** for quick access to user icons.
7. **MUI library** for using and customizing ready UI components (accordion component)
8. **FramerMotion library** to build animation on scrolling.
9. Nex.JS video, image and font **optimization features**.
10. **Vercel** for comfortable deployment.
